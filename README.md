Work:



python ddos.py

Enter a url (with http or https)

Enter a power

Attention. If you specify too high a power, the program will not work correctly. 
For correct operation, 
I recommend using power 1 for devices with average performance, 0.5 for older phones and 2 for flagships. 
If you are using a device with a very high performance, then you can specify numbers higher.
